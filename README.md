# 🙌 Hello!

Welcome to my profile! I do not know why you are here, considering I am not the best at coding, nor have I been involved in a huge project yet.


### 🔎 Who are you?

I am Double. I am still a student, therefore my schedule is limited due to having to study. However, in my freetime I enjoy playing games,
coding, sharpening my art skills or just jamming to music!


### 🏷 Why is your account so new?

I used to only use GitHub repositories as a private cloud storage for most my projects. However, I decided to finally make a public account, so I
could have a portfolio of sorts.


### 📑 What is it that you do?

I am currently front-end based, however I am trying to move towards being full-stack! I am currently invested in web development, however I
sometimes make Discord bots using **Discord.js**. At the moment I am trying to pick up MERN stack, due to it being interesting, and recommendation
from friendly foes.


### 📞 How do I get in contact with you?

I am not planning nor willing to make a work gmail, or such anytime soon, therefore the only way you can reach out to me at the moment is
using Discord.
